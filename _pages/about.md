I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Health Equity Data Lab](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/centers-and-labs/nhealth-equity-data-lab-hedl/) at the Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society, University of Notre Dame. My research focuses on understanding and addressing health disparities through the lens of social and political determinants of health.

Research Interests
======
My work examines the intersection of public administration, social capital, local government, and health equity. I am particularly interested in:

* **Political Determinants of Health**: How governmental structures, policies, and responsiveness shape health outcomes and disparities
* **Social Capital and Health Equity**: Understanding the complex role of community social capital in reducing or exacerbating health disparities across racial and socioeconomic groups
* **Health Equity**: Investigating disparities in health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations including racial minorities and Indigenous communities
* **Local Government and Public Policy**: Examining how local governance structures and policies impact community well-being and equity

Current Research
======
My current work involves several projects at the intersection of health equity and public administration:

* **Indigenous Health Disparities**: Leading research on cancer prevalence, screening disparities, and the unequal distribution of healthcare resources affecting American Indian and Alaska Native Medicare beneficiaries
* **AI and Local Government**: Analyzing health equity content in county government websites using large language models, and developing interactive tools for public engagement with local government data
* **Community Context and Health**: Investigating how political polarization and racial segregation moderate the relationship between social capital and health outcomes

I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from Florida State University in 2024, where my dissertation examined the determinants of health disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of social and governmental responsiveness.
