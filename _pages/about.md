I'm a public administration scholar who fights for health and health equity. I believe public administration is a practical discipline with heart. As a scholar in this field, I am dedicated to engaging with fundamental societal issues. It's the government's accountability and responsibility to ensure a healthier and happier future.  

I earned my Ph.D. in Public Administration from Florida State University in 2024, where my dissertation examined the determinants of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of social and governmental responsiveness. My work integrates public administration, public health, and computational methods to understand how political and social factors shape health outcomes and health equity.

Research Interests
======
My research agenda centers on understanding how governance, technology, and social structures shape health and equity. I am particularly interested in:

* **Inequality**: Examining racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in health outcomes and access to resources, with a focus on vulnerable populations including Medicare beneficiaries and Indigenous communities
* **Social and Political Determinants of Health**: How governmental structures, policies, responsiveness, community social capital, political polarization, and racial segregation affect health outcomes and health equity
* **Local Government**: The role of local government institutions and policies in shaping public health outcomes, service delivery, and civic engagement
* **Trustworthy AI**: Developing and evaluating AI systems for public sector applications—ensuring fairness, transparency, and alignment with public values in tools used for policy analysis and service delivery
