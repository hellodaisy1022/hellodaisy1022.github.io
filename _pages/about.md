I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Health Equity Data Lab](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/centers-and-labs/nhealth-equity-data-lab-hedl/) at the Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society, University of Notre Dame. My research focuses on the political determinants of health, social capital, local government, and health disparities.

I earned my Ph.D. in Public Administration from Florida State University in 2024, where my dissertation examined the determinants of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of social and governmental responsiveness. My work integrates public administration, public health, and computational methods to understand how political and social factors shape health outcomes and health equity.

Research Interests
======
My research agenda centers on understanding the political and social determinants of health disparities in the United States. I am particularly interested in:

* **Political Determinants of Health**: How governmental structures, policies, and responsiveness affect health outcomes and disparities
* **Social Capital and Health**: The complex relationship between community social capital, political polarization, racial segregation, and health equity
* **Local Government and Health**: The role of local government institutions and policies in shaping public health outcomes
* **Health Disparities**: Examining racial and socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes, with a focus on vulnerable populations including Medicare beneficiaries and Indigenous communities

Current Projects
======
I am currently working on several research projects funded by the [iTREDS Scholar Program](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/education/itreds/), including:

* Using large language models to analyze health equity content in county government websites
* Comparing AI and human-labeled data in local government policy analysis
* Developing interactive tools for public engagement with local government data

I am also leading research on cancer disparities among American Indian and Alaska Native populations, examining both prevalence patterns and the political determinants affecting healthcare resource distribution in Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Areas.
